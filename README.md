# :construction: THIS APP IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

## I'VE STARTED THIS APP AS A DRAFT TO MAKE SURE I CAN BUILD IT
(so... it is a mess :poop:)

:fire: BUT Right now I am refactoring it:
- I'll try to follow atomic design principles,
- I will switch from MUI to plain CSS to practice it (as I'm still not a CSS master yet)
- I will use React Context API to store information.

## WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT?
- It's a CRUD app on the maps. You'll be able to add Parcels (lots) based on coordinates from the map (onClick).
- You'll be able to add Owners to given Parcels. 
- Make Notes on the map and reassign them to given Parcel or Owner.
- Add Polilynes based on XY coordinates in any coordinates system existing in Poland.
